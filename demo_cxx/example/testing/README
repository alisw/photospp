This directory contains a number of MC-TESTER tests which can be
performed to validate the currently installed version of PHOTOS 
and it's iterface against a benchmark version. It uses the
example "photos_pythia_example" and "tauola_photos_pythia_example"
so any changes to this will also alter the tests. Some variable 
for the test. eg. number of events can be changed in test.inc

To run, compile photos_pythia_example.c and tauola_photos_pythia_example.c, 
then type "make" in this directory. MC-TESTER booklets can be found 
in the following subdirectories. You can run a single test by typing 
"make <booklet name>" in the corresponding subdirectory.
