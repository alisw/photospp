Changelog for changes with respect to version 3.0
-------------------------------------------------

Dec 10 2011
- Release 3.3 (sent to LCG for installation).
- NLO installed in all options and demos: for Z W and scalars decays.
- Cleaning of the configuration scripts and LCG scripts completed
- All tests passed. Up-to-date READMES, headers of all root benchmark files, 
  options in test programs.
- Several older benchmark files for NLO tests added for reference. Available
  for comparisons with  advanced options of test programs; options
  described in 'examples/testing/README-comparison-options'

- Example using interface without HepMC added
- To  compile without HepMC use:
  ./configure --without-hepmc

Nov 11 2011
 - Long tests with SANC at sub 0.01 % level went fine
   for single photon version of W decay at NLO, see:
   http://annapurna.ifj.edu.pl/~wasm/photosNLOtest.html
 - Maximum weight over-run for W decay localized and fixed.
 - NLO in scalar to two saclars active, but demos are missing some explanations
   and activation examples. 
 - NLO exp W decay still missing test benchmarks.

Apr 26 2011
 - NLO for W decay installed, some tests went OK, but need continuation
 - NLO in scalar to two saclars not active, but code is already in.

Mar 28 2011
- Added instalation scripts for LCG.

Dec 23 2010
- Bug resulting in NaN's on some platforms fixed
-draft of ZmumuNLO example/testing added
Dec 22 2010 
- First order NLO version checked
-numerical stability on other platforms must be verified
-version of reduction procedures remain to be re-checked as well
Dec 21 2010
- First long sample tests start to come OK, demos are not prepared.
  Note difference at 0.05 % level with respect to NLO paper from 2007.
  Different option of matching consecutive emission is used. Point will be 
  clarified later. 
- First order NLO version remain unchecked.
Dec 12 2010
- First  tests of NLO installation start to come out OK 

Dec 10 2010
- NLO option drafted into the code, no tests performed

Dec 5 2010
- Added: methods for option  complete matrix element calculation 
  (prepared in detail for Z/gamma only)
  WARNING: Implementation of matrix element for Z/gamma at work.
- Numerically insignificant fix for the bug reported by Savinov. 
   Result was that for photons of energies below .0001 of decaying particle 
   mass final state charged particles were getting unphysical mass in event 
   record.  

Nov 8 2010
- Fixed small typo in configuration help printout
