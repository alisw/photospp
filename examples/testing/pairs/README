This is at work.
We collecxt the most elementary tests of pair emission algorithm.
We start from generating sample
e+e---> Z --> mu+mu-
and adding pairs with MC tester. Many of these tests require intervention 
in the code.

1)
==
We run standard MC-tester on Z decays. Later we add some user-analysis
plots as well.	
// 2. Initialize pythia (argv[2], from console)
	else if(atoi(argv[2])==1) pythia.init( 11, -11, 91.187);
should be a good choice for the start.

2)
==
to recompile/reload (typically src/photos-fortran files photosC.cxx 
and photos-pair.cxx will change) one has to:
.....

3)
==
WHAT WE SHOULD DO as early tests:
1) pair generator as flat phase generator, 
2) virtuality of pair
3) energy of pair
4) angle: pair with respect to  lepton(s)

4)
==
at present all these plots need the code to be modified/recompiled
in fact written as well.
