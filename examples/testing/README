---------------------------------------------------------------------------
This directory contains a number of MC-TESTER tests which can be performed
to validate the currently installed version of PHOTOS and it's interface
against benchmark version
---------------------------------------------------------------------------


These tests use examples provided in "examples" directory.
Any changes to these files will also alter the tests.

To run, compile photos_pythia_example.c and tauola_photos_pythia_example.c,
then type "make" in this directory. You can run a single test by typing
"make" in the corresponding subdirectory. MC-TESTER booklets can be found
in the subdirectories of each test. The number of generated events can be
set in "test.inc" file.

Examples using photos_pythia_example:
- Wenu
- Wmunu
- Zee
- Zmunu
- ttbar

Examples using tauola_photos_pythia_example:
- Htautau
- Ztautau


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
These tests use special options of examples provided with PHOTOS. List of
modes used for generation is located in "test.inc" file; an appropriate
mode is selected in "Makefile" of each test. In general, these options
should not be changed. Generation setup can be altered in the code of
photos_pythia_example.c and tauola_photos_pythia.c instead.
