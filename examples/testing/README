---------------------------------------------------------------------------
This directory contains a number of MC-TESTER tests which can be performed
to validate the currently installed version of PHOTOS and its interface
against the benchmark versions
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

These tests use code located in "photos_test.c" and "phtost_tauola_test.c".
These files contain hardcoded options for all of the tests and are not
designed to be modified by user. For users willing to test or learn usage
of different options, examples provided in "PHOTOS/examples" directory are
of much more help.

To run, type "make" in this directory. You can run a single test by typing
"make" in the corresponding subdirectory. After the test is completed,
 MC-TESTER booklets can be found in the subdirectories of each test.
The number of generated events can be set in the "test.inc" file.

Note that examples:
- Htautau
- Ztautau

use "photos_tauola_test.c", which requires that path to Tauola C++ Interface
is provided during configuration.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The list of modes and options used for generation is located in the
"test.inc" file. Most of the benchmark files can be used without
modification or by applying small changes to Makefile or SETUP.C files
located in each subdirectory.

Full list of such changes is located in:     README-comparison-options
