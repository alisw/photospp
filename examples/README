Photos C++ Interface - Examples
-------------------------------

1)
To compile:
-  "./configure"
-  "make"

2)
The examples require more software than the interface itself:

./configure --with-Tauola=<path>         - provides path for Tauola
./configure --with-Pythia8=<path>        - provides path for Pythia8
./configure --with-MC-Tester=<path>      - provides path for MC-Tester

To use MC-Tester, ROOT must be installed and
its path provided via the PATH variable.

3)
If afs paths were used during interface compilation,
all these paths are set alredy and 
can not be changed.

4)
Examples require:
photos_standalone_example.exe    - does not require any new libraries
single_photos_gun_example.exe    - require Pythia8
photos_pythia_example.exe        - require Pythia8, ROOT and MC-Tester
tauola_photos_pythia_example.exe - require Pythia8, Tauola, ROOT and MC-Tester
